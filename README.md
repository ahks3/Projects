This is a respository which includes small pieces of code I've worked on while pursuing my degree.

---Explanations---

* CryptoPython.py - This project is based on the Udemy Course 'Cryptography and Hashing Fundamentals in Python and Java' by, 'Holczer Balazs'. The program is a mix of my own implementations and learning with the mathematical/programming concepts taught in Balazs' course. The script gathers user inputs in a terminal and can perform basic brute forcing and frequency analysis against a Caesar Cipher. Future plans are to follow the rest of Balazs' Course to include implementations of AES, RSA, and ECC.

* Into to Python Final - Punnet Square Generator : The script uses a class to gather user inputs in a terminal including the Trait Name, Letter, Zygosity, and Recessive/Dominant attributes. The script uses this information to output a completed 4x4 punnet square with accompanied percentages for each phenotype.
